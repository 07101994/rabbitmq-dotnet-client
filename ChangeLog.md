### No lock contention at consumer work service

Switched to a "thread-per-model" approach in the `ConsumerWorkService`.

longer be used to control concurrency.

Utility class changes:

- `BatchingWorkPool` has been removed
- `ConsumerWorkService` no longer has a constructor that takes a `TaskScheduler`
- `ConsumerWorkService.MAX_THUNK_EXECUTION_BATCH_SIZE` has been removed
- `ConsumerWorkService` no longer has the `ExecuteThunk` or `RegisterKey` methods
