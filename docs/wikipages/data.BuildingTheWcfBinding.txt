** Build Prerequisites

To compile the RabbitMQ .NET WCF binding, you will need

 - Microsoft .NET framework v2.0 (for [code csc] and [code msbuild])

 - Microsoft .NET framework v3.0 (for the WCF libraries)

 - Either
   - NAnt v0.85 or compatible, or
   - direct use of MSBuild, or
   - use of Visual Studio

You will also need to have compiled the core RabbitMQ .NET C# client
library (see BuildingTheClient).

** Building with NAnt

To run a particular build target, run

@code sh
  NAnt.exe [targetname]

*** clean-wcf

Removes the WCF build products.

*** build-wcf

Builds the WCF binding DLL, by calling out to [code msbuild]. The
[code msbuild.exe] program must be on the PATH.

*** wcf-examples

Generates the example WCF clients and servers.

** Build Products

The build products available after a successful [code nant wcf-examples] are:

 - [code src/wcf/RabbitMQ.ServiceModel/bin/] - directory containing WCF binding assemblies
 - [code src/wcf/Test/bin] - directory containing WCF binding assemblies and WCF example clients and servers.
